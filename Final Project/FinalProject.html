<main> A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic
 disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their
  treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or
  craft of medicine.
